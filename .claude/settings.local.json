      "Guidelines for configuration and dependency management\n\nCore rules\n- Only declare configuration that differs from the tool/plugin default. If it works without explicit config, leave it out.\n- Do not repeat default values (including default times, thresholds, or flags).\n- Use pnpm for adding or updating dependencies.\n\nStyle and maintainability\n- Keep configs minimal and focused: one change per entry.\n- Prefer clarity and readability: short keys, sensible ordering, and comments when the rationale is non-obvious.\n- Avoid duplication across configs; centralize shared settings when appropriate.\n\nWhy this matters\n- Less code to maintain and review\n- Fewer regressions when defaults evolve\n- Cleaner, more readable repositories\n\n\nNotes\n- When writing plugin code, assume default behavior unless a test or requirement shows otherwise.\n- Document any non-default choices briefly so future maintainers know why they exist.\n\nwe are using zorin os to run or build use host-spawn before the command to run or build the project\n- For example, to run the development server, use: host-spawn pnpm dev\n- To build the project, use: host-spawn pnpm build",
